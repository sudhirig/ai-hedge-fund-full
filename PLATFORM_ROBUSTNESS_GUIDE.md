### ‚úÖ **Health Monitoring**
- Continuous health checks every 30 seconds
- API endpoint validation
- Process monitoring and automatic restarts
- Comprehensive logging system

### ‚úÖ **Self-Healing Mechanisms**
- Automatic service restart on failures (up to 3 attempts)
- Port conflict resolution
- Dependency validation and installation
- Environment setup verification

### ‚úÖ **Developer UX Improvements**
- Color-coded logging with timestamps
- Detailed error reporting
- Service status dashboard
- Log rotation and organization

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Start the Complete Platform
```bash
# Start both backend and frontend with monitoring
./scripts/start-platform.sh start

# Check platform status
./scripts/start-platform.sh status

# Restart platform
./scripts/start-platform.sh restart

# Stop platform
./scripts/start-platform.sh stop
```

### Start Individual Services
```bash
# Backend only
./scripts/start-backend.sh

# Frontend only  
./scripts/start-frontend.sh
```

---

## üìä Monitoring & Health Checks

### Health Check Endpoints
- **Backend Health**: `http://localhost:8000/health`
- **Frontend Health**: `http://localhost:3000`

### Log Files
All logs are stored in `/logs/` directory:
- `platform.log` - Master orchestrator logs
- `backend.log` - Backend service logs
- `frontend.log` - Frontend service logs
- `backend-install.log` - Backend dependency installation
- `frontend-install.log` - Frontend dependency installation

### Service Status Monitoring
```bash
# Real-time platform status
./scripts/start-platform.sh status

# View live logs
tail -f logs/platform.log
```

---

## üîß Technical Details

### Backend Script Features (`start-backend.sh`)
- **Environment Validation**: Checks Python, Poetry, and project structure
- **Dependency Management**: Automated Poetry installation with error handling
- **Port Management**: Automatic port conflict resolution
- **Health Verification**: Waits for API to be responsive before proceeding
- **Retry Logic**: Up to 3 startup attempts with cleanup between failures

### Frontend Script Features (`start-frontend.sh`)
- **Environment Validation**: Checks Node.js, npm, and React project structure
- **Clean Installation**: Removes node_modules and reinstalls dependencies
- **Backend Connectivity**: Verifies backend availability (non-blocking)
- **Compilation Monitoring**: Waits for React compilation to complete
- **Network Access**: Provides both localhost and network IP access

### Platform Orchestrator Features (`start-platform.sh`)
- **Service Coordination**: Manages both backend and frontend lifecycle
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring with automatic restart
- **Log Management**: Centralized logging with rotation
- **Process Supervision**: Tracks PIDs and handles graceful shutdowns
- **Status Dashboard**: Real-time service status reporting

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables
The scripts automatically detect and use these environment variables:
- `BACKEND_PORT` - Backend API port (default: 8000)
- `FRONTEND_PORT` - Frontend dev server port (default: 3000)
- `HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL` - Monitoring interval in seconds (default: 30)
- `MAX_RESTART_ATTEMPTS` - Maximum restart attempts (default: 3)

### Customization
You can modify script behavior by editing the configuration section at the top of each script:

```bash
# In start-platform.sh
BACKEND_PORT=8000
FRONTEND_PORT=3000
HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL=30
MAX_RESTART_ATTEMPTS=3
```

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### **Port Already in Use**
```bash
# Scripts automatically handle port conflicts
# Manual check:
lsof -i :8000  # Backend
lsof -i :3000  # Frontend
```

#### **Missing Dependencies**
```bash
# Backend
cd backend && poetry install

# Frontend  
cd frontend && npm install
```

#### **Environment Variables Not Set**
```bash
# Check backend .env file
ls -la backend/.env

# Copy from template if missing
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

#### **Service Won't Start**
```bash
# Check logs for detailed error information
cat logs/platform.log
cat logs/backend.log
cat logs/frontend.log
```

### Debug Mode
For detailed debugging, you can run scripts with verbose output:
```bash
# Enable debug mode
set -x
./scripts/start-platform.sh start
```

## üìã Health Check Details

### Backend Health Response
```json
{
  "status": "healthy|degraded|unhealthy",
  "timestamp": 1234567890,
  "environment": {
    "financial_api": true,
    "anthropic_api": true,
    "openai_api": true
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "main_script": true,
    "pandas": true
  },
  "warnings": []
}
```

### Service Health Indicators
- **‚úÖ Healthy**: All systems operational
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Degraded**: Some non-critical issues
- **‚ùå Unhealthy**: Critical failures detected

---

## üîÑ Auto-Recovery Process

1. **Detection**: Health check fails
2. **Logging**: Issue logged with timestamp
3. **Restart**: Service restart attempted (up to 3 times)
4. **Validation**: Health check performed after restart
5. **Notification**: Success/failure logged
6. **Escalation**: Manual intervention required after max attempts

---

## üìà Performance Optimizations

### Startup Optimizations
- Parallel dependency installation where possible
- Smart caching of npm/Poetry dependencies
- Optimized health check intervals
- Efficient port scanning and cleanup

### Resource Management
- Automatic log rotation (10MB limit)
- Process cleanup on script termination
- Memory-efficient monitoring loops
- Minimal resource overhead during normal operation

---

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### Force Stop All Services
```bash
# Kill all platform processes
pkill -f "uvicorn api:app"
pkill -f "npm start"
pkill -f "start-platform.sh"

# Clean up PID files
rm -f .*.pid
```

### Reset Platform State
```bash
# Stop services
./scripts/start-platform.sh stop

# Clean logs
rm -rf logs/*

# Reset dependencies
cd backend && rm -rf .venv
cd frontend && rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Fresh start
./scripts/start-platform.sh start
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### Development Workflow
1. Always use the platform orchestrator for full development
2. Check logs regularly for early warning signs
3. Use status command to verify service health
4. Gracefully stop services using the provided scripts

### Production Considerations
- Monitor logs for patterns indicating recurring issues
- Set up external monitoring for the health endpoints
- Consider implementing alerting for critical failures
- Regular backup of configuration and logs

### Contributing
When modifying the robustness scripts:
1. Test thoroughly in development environment
2. Maintain backward compatibility
3. Update this guide with any new features
4. Add appropriate logging for debugging

---

## üìû Support

For issues with the robustness system:
1. Check the logs in `/logs/` directory
2. Run status check: `./scripts/start-platform.sh status`
3. Try restart: `./scripts/start-platform.sh restart`
4. Review this guide for common solutions
5. If issues persist, check individual service logs for specific errors
