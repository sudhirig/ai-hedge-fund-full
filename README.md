# AI Hedge Fund

This is a proof of concept for an AI-powered hedge fund.  The goal of this project is to explore the use of AI to make trading decisions.  This project is for **educational** purposes only and is not intended for real trading or investment.

This system employs several agents working together:

1. Ben Graham Agent - The godfather of value investing, only buys hidden gems with a margin of safety
2. Bill Ackman Agent - An activist investors, takes bold positions and pushes for change
3. Cathie Wood Agent - The queen of growth investing, believes in the power of innovation and disruption
4. Charlie Munger Agent - Warren Buffett's partner, only buys wonderful businesses at fair prices
5. Phil Fisher Agent - Legendary growth investor who mastered scuttlebutt analysis
6. Stanley Druckenmiller Agent - Macro legend who hunts for asymmetric opportunities with growth potential
7. Warren Buffett Agent - The oracle of Omaha, seeks wonderful companies at a fair price
8. Valuation Agent - Calculates the intrinsic value of a stock and generates trading signals
9. Sentiment Agent - Analyzes market sentiment and generates trading signals
10. Fundamentals Agent - Analyzes fundamental data and generates trading signals
11. Technicals Agent - Analyzes technical indicators and generates trading signals
12. Risk Manager - Calculates risk metrics and sets position limits
13. Portfolio Manager - Makes final trading decisions and generates orders

## 🚦 How to Start Backend and Frontend (Local Development)

**Quick Start (Recommended for Most Users):**

1. **Install all dependencies first:**
   - Backend: `cd backend && poetry install`
   - Frontend: `cd frontend && npm install`
2. **Unified Startup:**
   - From the project root: `./run.sh`
   - This will launch both backend (FastAPI) and frontend (React) with monitoring/restart logic.
3. **Manual Startup (if you want to run separately):**
   - **Backend:**
     ```bash
     cd backend
     poetry install
     poetry run uvicorn api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
     ```
   - **Frontend:**
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     npm start
     ```

**Troubleshooting:**
- If backend fails to start, run `poetry lock` then `poetry install` inside `backend/` to fix dependency mismatches.
- If `uvicorn` is not found, ensure you are using Poetry (`poetry run uvicorn ...`), or check your Python environment.
- Health check: [http://localhost:8000/health](http://localhost:8000/health)
- Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Setup

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/virattt/ai-hedge-fund.git
cd ai-hedge-fund
```

1. Install Poetry (if not already installed):
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
poetry install
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
# Create .env file for your API keys
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Set your API keys:
```bash
# For running LLMs hosted by openai (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, etc.)
# Get your OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# For running LLMs hosted by groq (deepseek, llama3, etc.)
# Get your Groq API key from https://groq.com/
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key

# For getting financial data to power the hedge fund
# Get your Financial Datasets API key from https://financialdatasets.ai/
FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY=your-financial-datasets-api-key
```

**Important**: You must set `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` for the hedge fund to work.  If you want to use LLMs from all providers, you will need to set all API keys.

Financial data for AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, NVDA, and TSLA is free and does not require an API key.

For any other ticker, you will need to set the `FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY` in the .env file.

## Usage

### Running the Hedge Fund
```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA
```

**Example Output:**
<img width="992" alt="Screenshot 2025-01-06 at 5 50 17 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8ca04bf-9989-4a7d-a8b4-34e04666663b" />

You can also specify a `--show-reasoning` flag to print the reasoning of each agent to the console.

```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --show-reasoning
```
You can optionally specify the start and end dates to make decisions for a specific time period.

```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-03-01 
```

### Running the Backtester

```bash
poetry run python src/backtester.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA
```

**Example Output:**

You can optionally specify the start and end dates to backtest over a specific time period.

```bash
poetry run python src/backtester.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-03-01
```

## Deploying to Replit

This project can be deployed to Replit for easy sharing and collaboration. Follow these steps:

1. Create a new Replit project
2. Import your code from GitHub or upload the files directly
3. Replit will automatically detect the configuration from the `.replit` and `replit.nix` files
4. Click the "Run" button to start both the backend and frontend servers
5. The application will be available at your Replit URL

The application uses the following configuration for Replit:
- Backend: Python FastAPI running on port 8000
- Frontend: React app running on port 3000
- The `run.sh` script coordinates starting both services

### Replit Environment Variables

If you need to configure API keys or other sensitive information, add them as Replit Secrets in the project settings.
